This is a work project for a beginner Android Developer class. 
It was cut a little short so some of the features aren't very fleshed out, debugged, or optimized.
The program is a basic Android app that uses GitHub's API to search for trending repos.
It displays trending repos in a list that the user can look through/interact with.
If the user clicks on a repo in the list it will show the repo on a new screen with a little
more information.

To run the program you have to download and extract the zip, then you need to open the extracted
files in Android Studio. Run the app in an emulator of your desired device and it should open.
